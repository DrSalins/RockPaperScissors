## Cloning

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DrSalins/RockPaperScissors.git
```

## Usage

Clone the project, open it in your IDE, and then open the file 
```
index.html
```
After doing so, once the page is open click on the button that says Click Here! Immediately the game will start, the process of how this works is that you are asked to make a choice between rock, paper & scissors and then the computer will randomly pick an option and it alerts you what the computer picked. It proceeds to check against the conditions that we have set

## Cases [Logic behind the game]

Case 1 -: It's a TIE! The computer and you picked the same option

Case 2 - [Computer Picked ROCK]: If the computer picks ROCK, and you pick PAPER then you have won! But if you picked SCISSORS then the computer has won!

Case 3 - [Computer Picked PAPER]: If the computer picks PAPER, and you have picked SCISSORS then you have won! But if you picked ROCK, then the computer has won!

Case 4 - [Computer Picked SCISSORS]: If the computer picks SCISSORS, and you have picked ROCK then you have won! But if you picked PAPER, then the computer won!

In addition to these cases, throughout the game, if you have entered anything other than rock, paper, or scissors the game will alert you with a dialog box explaining that you have entered gibberish!
